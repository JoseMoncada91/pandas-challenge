Jose Moncada - Pandas Challenge
School Performance and Spending Analysis

Background
As the Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district, you are tasked with providing insights that will help the school board and mayor make informed decisions regarding budgets and academic priorities.
Your first assignment is to analyze district-wide standardized test results, which include student math and reading scores along with details about each school.
This analysis aims to identify key trends in performance and provide actionable insights related to school size, type, and spending.

Analysis Tasks
The report includes a district-wide overview of key metrics, a breakdown of performance for individual schools, and a comparison of the top- and lowest-performing institutions.
The analysis also investigates math and reading scores by grade level and examines the relationship between per-student spending and academic success.
The goal is to understand how different factors such as budget, size, and school type influence student outcomes and to offer recommendations for future resource allocation.

File Overview
schools_complete.csv: Contains details about each school (name, type, budget, student count).

PyCitySchools_JoseMoncada.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis.

Conclusion
This analysis offers critical insights into how factors like spending, school size, and type affect student achievement.
It provides the foundation for data-driven decision-making that can help optimize resource allocation and enhance academic performance district-wide.
